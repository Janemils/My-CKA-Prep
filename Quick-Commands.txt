1. To output the yaml of a pod to a file:
kubectl run nginx --image=nginx --dry-run=client -o yaml > pod-template.yaml

2. Difference between replication controller and replication set:
Replication Controller can manage only the pods created within the RC and is a legacy feature.
Replication Set can manage even the existing pods using selectors.

3. To edit a live object:
kubectl edit rs/frontend

4. To scale up or down the number of replicas:
kubectl scale --replicas=4 rs/frontend

5. To rollout to a newer version with a change cause:
k set image deployment/nginx nginx:1.23.4

6. Rollout history and to rollback:
k rollout history deploy/nginx
k rollout undo deploy/nginx --to-revision=1

7. Exec into a pod:
 k exec -it deploy-nm1-7d84fc98d5-d74hl -n nm-1 -- sh
 
8. Create a service and expose a deployment to the service the imperative way.
k expose deploy/deploy-nm1 --name=svc-nm1 -n nm-1 --port=80

9. FQDN [Fully Qualified Domain Name}:
curl svc-nm2.nm2.svc.cluster.local
[<service-name>.<namespace>.svc.cluster.local]

10. Cron Job syntax:
[Minute (0-59)] [Hour (0-23)] [Day of Month (1-31)] [Month (1-12)]  [Day of week (0{sun}-6{sat})]

To run a build every 5 minutes:
*/5 * * * *

11. All the static pod manifest files in /etc/kubernetes/manifests path.

12. To go inside the docker container (Node) for kind cluster:
docker exec -it <container-name> bash 

13. To label a node: 
k label node cka-cluster-worker gpu="true"

14. To remove the label of a node:
k label node cka-cluster-worker gpu-

15. To taint a node:
k taint node cka-cluster-worker gpu=true:NoSchedule

16.To remove the taint on a node:
k taint node cka-cluster-worker gpu=true:NoSchedule-

17. To check for where the kubelet is looking for creating the static pods, i.e static pod path, ssh into the worker node or the node where kubelet is up and running.
Look for the config.yaml [Mostly in /var/lib/kubelet/config.yaml in the newer kubernetes versions.] and look out for the field 'staticPodPath'.
